The gem also provides methods to mixin to your application's User model which will be helpful.


h2. Usage


h2. Installation

To enable the library your Rails 2.1 (or greater) project, use the gem configuration method in "<code>config/environment.rb</code>"

<pre>
Rails::Initializer.run do |config|
  config.gem 'moorage-thrivesmart_accounts_gem', :lib => 'thrivesmart_accounts_gem', :source => 'http://gems.github.com'
end
</pre>

The <code>:lib</code> is important, because rails gets confused when the name of the gem is different from the library.

And of course, run 

<pre>
  rake gems:install
</pre>

To get them installed on your system.

Optionally, to unpack it into your application, just run:

<pre>
  rake gems:unpack GEM=moorage-thrivesmart_accounts_gem
</pre>
